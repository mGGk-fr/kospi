Multiple setup will be aviable for multiple functionnality (web server/vpn server/samba server...)\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n====\r\nMy goal was to create a fast-booting distribution on my RPi 2 for my web developpement. I decided to share this distribution with the world !\r\nThe distribution is actually in developpment, it will be aviable as soon as possible !\r\n\r\nWhy kOsPi ?\r\n===\r\nIn the beginning, i've name this thing \"mGGkOsPi for \"mGGk OS for Pi\". But this name sounds bad ! So i've shortened it to \"kOsPi\" ( much easier to pronounce !).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
