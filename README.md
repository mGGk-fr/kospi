# kOsPi
kOsPi is an embbeded distribution for RPi 2. Multiple setup will be aviable for multiple functionnality (web server/vpn server/samba server...)

Introduction
====
My goal was to create a fast-booting distribution on my RPi 2 for my web developpement. I decided to share this distribution with the world !
The distribution is actually in developpment, it will be aviable as soon as possible !

Why kOsPi ?
===
In the beginning, i've name this thing "mGGkOsPi for "mGGk OS for Pi". But this name sounds bad ! So i've shortened it to "kOsPi" ( much easier to pronounce !).
